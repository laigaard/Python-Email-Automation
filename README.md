## Python Email Automation Script

This script was designed to solve a time consuming issue that a business loan broker faces on a daily bases: sending the same email separately to multiple lending companies.


As a loan broker, you'll need to submit a signed application and bank statements to various lenders that the business may qualify with.  It is a simple task that can quickly take up an hour or two of the workday depending on how many applicants you have so submit.
I thought it would be interesting to explore if this process could be automated via scripting.  While it is technically possible, it is worth mentioning that this specific script likely couldn't be used in production as it requires the user to lower the security on their gmail account.
