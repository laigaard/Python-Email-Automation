# Python Email Automation Script

This branch, named "example", is set up to show you a working example of the script.  The main branch requires you to fill some key variable before using, so having a clear functioning example to reference was important for ease of use.

The project started by going through a Real Python article by Joska de Langen called "Sending Emails With Python" and was then adapted and expanded to meets the scope of this task.  (link: https://realpython.com/python-send-email/)
  
I'd also like to reference a GitHub project by user carnal0wnage titled "Python code for sending HTML email (Attachments + Multiple Recipients)".  This script helped me visualize the logic needed to re-package much of my code into a function so the script could go from sending to one recipient to multiple.
